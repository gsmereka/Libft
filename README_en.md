Standard functions C library

This library contains a set of standard functions in C that were implemented and tested by me. The functions were chosen based on their usefulness and frequency of use in C projects. In addition to learning about the operation of these functions, the goal of this project was to create a useful library that can be used and enhanced in future projects at 42 SP.
