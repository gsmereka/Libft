## About the Project

This library was developed in a **Linux** environment and contains a set of standard functions in **C** that were implemented and tested by me. In addition to learning about the functioning of these functions, the goal of this project was to create a useful library that can be used and improved in other projects, including future projects at **[42 SP](https://github.com/gsmereka/42_Projects)**.

## How to Use Libft in Your Project

1. Check the [Dependencies](#dependencies).
2. Clone the Repository.
   - ```git clone https://github.com/gsmereka/Libft.git```
3. Compile the library.
   - ```cd libft```
   - ```make```
4. Include the libft header in your project's header. You can do this by adding the following line at the beginning of your file:
   - ```#include libtf/header/libft.h```
5. Compile your project including the libft.a file. For example:
   - ```gcc your_project.c Libft/libft.a -o your_project```

## Dependencies
